# 🎹 The Janky Piano Show presents Janky Requests 🎹
## What & Why?
My friend, [Hunter DeBlanc](https://www.hunterdeblanc.com/), is a musician who's released multiple singles, EP's, and albums over the past 10 years. In the summer of 2021, Hunter started a variety show hosted at the Grouse Room every Wednesday in Downtown Lafayette, LA.

It's chaotic, (mostly) unscripted, fueled by substances, interactive, funny, and wild. It's janky.

His co-host, Peyton, takes song requests from audience members. The solution for remembering these requests was either nothing or writing them down on a whiteboard.

This website is a solution for him, so audience members don't get pissed off if he forgets their requests. 😂
